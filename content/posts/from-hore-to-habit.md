Every time I joined a new project, I made it a point to take responsibility for fixing bugs. Why? Because fixing bugs is the best way to understand the architecture and get familiar with the codebase. Often, there‚Äôs little to no documentation, and all the knowledge is locked inside the developers‚Äô heads. By fixing bugs (and writing tests as I went) I created my own map to navigate the codebase, uncover its quirks, and ensure I wasn‚Äôt lost.

Writing tests isn‚Äôt just a technical task; it‚Äôs a mindset, a rhythm I‚Äôve developed over time. Test Driven Development [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) is now second nature to me. When I sit down to write a new feature, my first step isn‚Äôt writing the functionality itself. Instead, I start with the question: **What should this code do?** I define that behavior in the form of tests.

But it wasn‚Äôt always like this.

When I started out, I didn‚Äôt hate writing tests. In fact, I liked the idea from the moment I learned about it. Still, it was challenging. Writing unit tests required effort. Mocking, stubbing, and dealing with poorly designed code (much of which I had written myself) made testing harder than it needed to be. The problem wasn‚Äôt the concept of testing; it was the code, which hadn‚Äôt been designed with testing in mind.

Over time, though, I experienced the payoff. With practice and better design patterns, writing tests became second nature. Now, I can‚Äôt imagine working without them. Tests are the guardrails that let me move fast without fear of breaking things. They give me confidence to iterate, refactor, and push forward.

What if there are no bugs? What if everything just works? Test coverage might be 99%, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you fully understand how the application works.

While tests give you confidence in the functionality of your code, they don‚Äôt provide an overarching understanding of the system. That‚Äôs where documentation comes in.

If you‚Äôre like most developers, the idea of writing documentation probably makes you groan. It feels like a chore, much like writing unit tests did when I first started. Many of us struggle with documentation. We either overexplain irrelevant details, leave out critical information, or just skip it entirely.

Here‚Äôs the thing: writing documentation doesn‚Äôt have to be hard. Like testing, it can become a habit, a natural part of your workflow. All you need is the right method. And that method is [C4](https://c4model.com/).

Think of the C4 model as a framework to think about your system and communicate it clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Instead of writing endless pages of text, you create concise, visual diagrams that explain how your system works.

The C4 model breaks your system into four layers of abstraction:

- **Context**: What does the system do, and who uses it?
- **Containers**: What are the major building blocks (apps, databases, services)?
- **Components**: How are those building blocks broken down internally?
- **Code**: How does the actual code support the components? (Optional if you have inline documentation)

For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre working on an e-commerce platform:

- At the **Context** layer, you‚Äôd describe the overall system (an online store) and its users (customers, admins) along with external systems like payment processors.
- At the **Containers** layer, you‚Äôd identify the web app, the database, and APIs that make up the system.
- At the **Components** layer, you‚Äôd zoom into the web app and explain how features like the shopping cart and user authentication work internally.

The beauty of the C4 model is its simplicity. It captures the most important details without overwhelming readers. It‚Äôs focused, easy to understand, and effective.

Once you get into the flow of using the C4 model, writing documentation stops being a chore. It becomes part of your rhythm, just like writing unit tests. It‚Äôs no longer a big, scary task you put off until the end of the project, or never do at all. Instead, it‚Äôs something you do naturally as part of your development process.

Here‚Äôs my challenge to you: the next time you‚Äôre tempted to skip writing documentation, think back to how you felt about unit tests when you started. Remember how challenging they seemed at first? Consider using tools like [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) alongside the C4 model to create effective, visual documentation. Over time, just like testing, documentation will give you confidence and speed.

Unit tests and documentation aren‚Äôt just tools; they‚Äôre the guardrails that let us build with confidence, speed, and clarity. They separate good developers from great ones and reduce the infamous ‚Äúbus factor.‚Äù

Start small. Create your first Context diagram with the C4 model. Stick with it, and soon these habits will become second nature. Before long, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever worked without them.

Happy hacking! üöÄ
