      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think the best managers and developers are the ones with the most talent, the best technical skills, or the ability to tackle every problem. But in reality, what truly sets the best apart is knowing what doesn’t need their attention, at least not right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great manager isn’t just someone with strong leadership or communication skills. They don’t try to control every detail, join every meeting, or make every decision. Instead, they know which discussions, tasks, and problems can be avoided without consequence or delegated to someone else. Likewise, a great developer doesn’t obsess over every line of code or chase perfection where it’s not needed. They understand that “good enough” is often better than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
